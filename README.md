This project focuses on designing new primers for alpha and beta clonotypes using sequence data. It processes a FASTA file containing clonotype sequences, filters sequences based on predefined motifs, and applies primer design principles to generate optimal primers. The project leverages Python libraries such as primer3, pandas, and numpy to automate the identification and validation of primer sequences.
